 * Make an administrator panel

    - For managing server/network associations

    - Viewing bot status, including scheduled channel inspections

    - Scheduling and canceling bot actions.

    - Viewing log

    - Take database backups and download them

 * Schema wishlist

    - Integer primary keys may be preferable for the channel
      table. References to channels (in other tables and possible
      URLs) would then not have to be updated when the network given
      for a channel changes.

 * Channel list

    - Display the topic of the channel.

    - Add a 'irc://' link in channel items.

    - Make something better than just "Forrige"/"Neste"

 * Ensure that the web server will never stop without logging the
   reason (this happened in one instance).

    - Make sure that panics and errors in HTTP handlers are caught and
      handled properly

    - Make sure that process signals are logged

    - Make sure that panics and errors in the IRC bot thread are
      caught

 * Input handling
 
    - Remove whitespace from submissions.

 * Check for errors in RSS feed.

 * Remove Schema.org markup

 * Text
 
    - Make an 'Om siden' page describing the intention of
      the website.

    - Update the help page with respect to the new web design.

    - Give further instructions on the submit page:

       - Mention that the WebChat-URL is optional

       - Describe what sort of submissions are welcome
