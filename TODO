 * Make an administrator panel for managing server/network associations

 * Make the website record a history of number of active users.

 * Make a separate library for querying channels, and an associated
   command-line utility to test it with.

 * Make it so that for a network, it is possible to configure that
   queries should be done on another address (irc.inet.tele.dk seems
   to be more accepting of the bot than irc.efnet.org).

 * Gather and display the topic of the channel

 * Ensure that the web server will never stop without logging the
   reason (this happened in one instance).

    - Make sure that panics and errors in HTTP handlers are caught and
      handled properly

    - Make sure that process signals are logged

 * Ensure that each listed channel is unique and valid.

    - Handle addresses that point to the same host or are
      part of the same network.

 * Validate and canonicalize server addresses

 * Remove whitespace from submissions.

 * Improve multi-page layout.

    - Make something better than just "Forrige"/"Neste"

 * Check for errors in RSS feed.

 * Make an 'Om siden' page describing the intention of
   the website.

 * Give further instructions on the submit page:

    - Mention that the WebChat-URL is optional

    - Describe what sort of submissions are welcome
